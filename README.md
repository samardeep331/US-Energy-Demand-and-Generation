# US Energy Demand and Generation Forecasting

Forecasting of power generation and demand plays an essential role in the electric industry, as it provides the basis for making decisions in power system planning and
operation. In this project, I look at electricity generation and demand data from different regions in the US and apply various time series modeling algorithms to predict
the demand and thereby optimize generation of power for these regions for different time periods ranging from one hour to one year. 

The datasets used in this project are freely available at the US Energy Information Administration website. I am looking at data from July 2015 to March 2022.
I get the electricity demand data produced by different regions in the US from the following website:
